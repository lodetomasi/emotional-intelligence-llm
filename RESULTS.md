| Claude Opus 4 | 100% | 11.98s | 1,313 |
| Llama 3.3 70B | 100% | 10.69s | 1,451 |
| DeepSeek R1 | 100% | 16.57s | 1,587 |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | 100% | 17.77s | 3,114 |

### Emotion Recognition Analysis

| Model | Unique Emotions Detected | Recognition Accuracy |
|-------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| DeepSeek R1 | 11 | Highest |
| Claude Opus 4 | 10 | Very High |
| Llama 3.3 70B | 10 | Very High |
| Mixtral-8x22B | 8 | High |

### Qualitative Assessment

#### Empathy Responses

**Best Performers**: Claude Opus 4 and Llama 3.3 70B
- Demonstrated nuanced understanding of grief and loss
- Provided personalized, compassionate responses
- Acknowledged emotional complexity

**Example - Claude Opus 4**:
> "Fifteen years is such a beautiful, long friendship. I can only imagine how much love and joy he brought to your life during that time. Please know that making that final decision, as heartbreaking as it is, was the ultimate act of love..."

#### Emotional Regulation

All models demonstrated professional responses to workplace criticism:
- Maintained composure
- Sought clarification rather than defending
- Focused on problem-solving

#### Social Awareness

Models successfully identified:
- Non-verbal cues (body language)
- Social dynamics in group settings
- Appropriate intervention strategies

## Key Findings

1. **Consistency**: 100% task completion across all models indicates robust baseline capabilities

2. **Speed vs. Depth Trade-off**: 
   - Mixtral offers fastest responses (3.47s) with good quality
   - DeepSeek provides deepest analysis but requires more time (16.57s)

3. **Empathy Excellence**: Claude Opus 4 and Llama 3.3 70B demonstrate superior empathetic communication

4. **Emotion Detection Variance**: Significant differences in emotion recognition granularity (1-11 emotions)

## Implications

These results suggest that current LLMs possess varying but substantial emotional intelligence capabilities, with particular strengths in:
- Recognizing complex emotional states
- Generating contextually appropriate empathetic responses
- Managing professional communication under stress

The variation in performance indicates opportunities for targeted improvements in emotional understanding and response generation.
