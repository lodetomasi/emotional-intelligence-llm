# Emotional Intelligence in Large Language Models

A comprehensive framework for evaluating emotional intelligence capabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs through systematic testing and analysis.

## 🎯 Description

This research project investigates how different Large Language Models demonstrate emotional intelligence across four key dimensions: emotion recognition, empathy, emotional regulation, and social awareness. The framework provides quantitative and qualitative analysis of LLM responses to emotionally complex scenarios.

## 🔬 Key Features

- **Multi-dimensional EI testing** across 4 core emotional competencies
- **Comparative analysis** of 5 leading LLMs (Mixtral, Claude, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemini)
- **Real API integration** with OpenRouter for authentic model responses
- **Automated scoring system** with human-evaluator guidelines
- **Publication-ready visualizations** and statistical analysis
- **Extensible test framework** for adding new scenarios and models

## 📊 Research Applications

- Academic research on AI emotional capabilities
- Development of emotionally-aware AI systems
- Benchmarking LLM performance in human-centered tasks
- Improving AI-human interaction design

## 🚀 Quick Start
