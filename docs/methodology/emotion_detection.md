# Emotion Detection Methodology

## Overview

Our emotion detection approach uses a hybrid method combining pattern matching, contextual analysis, and confidence scoring to minimize bias and improve accuracy.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Context-Aware Detection

Instead of simple keyword matching, we implement:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Regular expressions to capture emotion expressions in context
- **Negation Handling**: Detects negated emotions (e.g., "not happy" vs "happy")
- **Proximity Analysis**: Considers word relationships within sentences

### 2. Confidence Scoring

Each detected emotion receives a confidence score (0-1) based on:

- **Keyword Matches**: 0.3 points per keyword
- **Pattern Matches**: 0.4 points per pattern
- **Context Bonus**: 0.1 points for contextual relevance

### 3. Evidence Tracking

For transparency, the system tracks:
- Which keywords triggered detection
- Which patterns matched
- Context snippets

## Emotion Categories

Primary emotions detected:
- Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust

Secondary emotions:
- Frustration, Guilt, Disappointment, Anxiety, Shame
- Pride, Jealousy, Hope, Relief

Complex emotions:
- Regret, Loneliness, Confusion, Overwhelm
- Helplessness, Resignation, Conflict

## Limitations

1. **Language Dependency**: Currently English-only
2. **Cultural Variations**: Western emotion expressions
3. **Irony/Sarcasm**: Limited detection capability
4. **Implicit Emotions**: May miss subtle implications

## Validation

Results should be validated through:
- Human expert review
- Cross-model comparison
- Context consideration
