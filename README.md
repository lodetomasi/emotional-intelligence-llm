# Emotional Intelligence in Large Language Models

A research project investigating the emotional intelligence capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs.

## 📚 Project Overview

This research examines how different Large Language Models demonstrate emotional intelligence across four key dimensions:

1. **Emotion Recognition** - Identifying emotions in text
2. **Empathy** - Understanding and responding to others' feelings  
3. **Emotional Regulation** - Managing appropriate emotional responses
4. **Social Awareness** - Understanding social and emotional contexts

## 🤖 Models Under Study

- **Mixtral-8x22B** (Mistral AI)
- **Claude Opus 4** (Anthropic)
- **Llama 3.3 70B** (Meta)
- **DeepSeek R1** (DeepSeek)
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Google)

## 🔬 Methodology

We employ a comprehensive test battery including:
- Emotion detection scenarios
- Empathy response tasks
- Emotional regulation challenges
- Social situation analysis

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn requests tqdm
```

2. Set your OpenRouter API key:
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

3. Run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook emotional_intelligence_test.ipynb
```

## 📊 Expected Outputs

- Comparative analysis of EI capabilities
- Visualizations of model performance
- Qualitative insights into emotional responses
- Research data for academic publication
